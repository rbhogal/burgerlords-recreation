                Due to the ongoing pandemic, we’re operating at an extremely
                limited capacity to keep our staff safe while we serve our
                community. This allows us to work more efficiently with a
                smaller team to maintain Burgerlords’ high standard of quality.
                As much as we’d like to personally answer each and every one of
                your questions, it is unfortunately not possible at the moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, below you’ll find answers to frequently asked
                questions. We’ll update this as more questions come up. Thank
                you for your understanding during these challenging times.
              </p>

            <strong>Is <em>(insert menu item) </em>vegan?</strong>
            <p>
              As of July 16, 2020 all current and future Burgerlords locations
              are 100% Vegan. Everything we serve on the menu–from burgers to
              sides to sauces to shakes–is vegan.
            </p>
            <strong>What are your hours?</strong>
            <p>Our current hours are Thursday - Sunday, 12PM - 8PM.</p>

            <strong>How do I order?</strong>
            <p>
              The best way to order is ahead of time via our online portal here:
              <a href="menu.html">Order Food</a>. Choose the desired location,
              place order and it will be ready in the designated time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Walk up orders are currently only possible at our Highland Park
              location.
            </p>

            <p>
              For our Chinatown location, please order through your phone here:
              Chinatown Pick-Up. Our space here is small, so we ask that you do
              this to ensure the safety of our staff and other guests. Let us
              know when your order is placed so we can start it for you right
              away!
            </p>

            <strong>Why is online ordering/postmates unavailable?</strong>
            <p>Two reasons:</p>

            <p>
              1. Sometimes when it is busy, we have to temporarily “snooze”
              online ordering. Check back momentarily and we will switch it back
              on when we can take more orders
            </p>

            <p>2. We are closed. Please check normal business hours.</p>

            <strong>Do you still have “XXXX” in stock?</strong>
            <p>
              If it is not available in the online ordering, then we currently
              do not have that item available to order.
            </p>

            <strong>Do you deliver?</strong>
            <p>
              We offer delivery through Postmates, Door Dash & Caviar. All links
              to services can be found under “Order Food” The price is 20%
              higher to compensate for the fees they charge us. We recommend
              ordering directly through our online system if possible.
            </p>

            <strong>Do you have gluten-free options? </strong>
            <p>
              Yes! We have a gluten-free bun, as well as gluten-free “Beefy”
              Patty. This patty contains soy, but is gluten-free and nut free.
              It’s produced by an outside vendor, and it’s one of the few things
              on our menu that we don’t make in-house.
            </p>

            <strong>Do I have to wear a mask? </strong>
            <p>
              YES. In an effort to keep our staff and community safe, all guests
              must wear a mask when coming through to pick-up. If you are not
              wearing a face covering, you will not be served.
            </p>

            <strong
              >Do you have a calorie count for
              <em>(insert menu item here)</em>?</strong
            >
            <p>
              We currently do not have calorie count for our house-made recipes.
            </p>

            <strong>Can we dine-in, eat on the patio? </strong>
            <p>We are currently takeaway only.</p>

            <strong>Do you accept cash? </strong>
            <p>
              We are temporarily not accepting cash. We also have now added
              Apple Pay and Google Pay.
            </p>
